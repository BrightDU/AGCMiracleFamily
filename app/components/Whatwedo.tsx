        At Carelife Foundation, our intervention and life skills projects are designed to help early lives transition into adulthood with a positive outlook. These programs are evidence-based, informed by in-depth research conducted by our team to identify real needs and develop the most effective strategies to address them.

        We employ a bottom-up approach, engaging the family and immediate community as key stakeholders and decision-makers in identifying problems interfering with a child&apos;s proper growth and development and crafting solutions to address these needs. This inclusive strategy ensures that our interventions are practical, relevant, and family-driven.

  Our work begins at the foundation of life, with our footprint at every critical development phaseâ€”from pregnancy and childbirth to childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood.
